**Status:** ⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY** - Advanced AI-Enhanced Trading System Framework
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Architecture:** 5-Layer Autonomous AI Trading Protocol
**Last Security Update:** June 17, 2025

## 🎯 Overview

THE OVERMIND PROTOCOL is an advanced AI-enhanced high-frequency trading system built in Rust, specifically designed for autonomous trading on the Solana blockchain. The system combines traditional HFT capabilities with cutting-edge AI decision-making through TensorZero optimization, creating a 5-layer autonomous trading architecture with long-term memory and adaptive learning.

## 🏗️ THE OVERMIND PROTOCOL Architecture

### 5-Layer Autonomous AI Trading System

**Layer 1: Forteca (Infrastructure)**
- **DataIngestor**: Real-time market data ingestion with 100ms intervals
- **Persistence**: SQLite + Vector database for AI memory
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive health and metrics tracking

**Layer 2: Zmysły (Intelligence)**
- **Market Analysis**: Multi-timeframe technical analysis
- **Signal Detection**: Pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- **Risk Assessment**: Real-time position and exposure management

**Layer 3: Mózg AI (AI Brain)**
- **TensorZero Gateway**: AI decision optimization engine
- **Vector Memory**: Long-term learning and pattern storage
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI decision quality assessment (70% threshold)

**Layer 4: Myśliwiec (Executor)**
- **HFT Engine**: Ultra-low latency execution (<25ms target)
- **Jito Integration**: MEV protection through bundle execution
- **Paper Trading**: Safe simulation mode for testing

**Layer 5: Centrum Kontroli (Control)**
- **Strategy Coordination**: Multi-strategy orchestration
- **Risk Management**: Position limits and safety controls
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time system optimization

### Communication

All modules communicate through Tokio MPSC channels for zero-latency inter-module communication:
- `market_data_channel`: DataIngestor → StrategyEngine
- `signal_channel`: StrategyEngine → RiskManager
- `execution_channel`: RiskManager → Executor
- `persistence_channel`: All modules → Persistence

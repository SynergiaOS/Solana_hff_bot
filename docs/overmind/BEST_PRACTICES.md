# SNIPERCOR - Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for Rust, AI, testing, and DevOps in the SNIPERCOR high-frequency trading system for Solana.

## Rust Best Practices

### 1. Leverage Rust's Ownership Model
- Use ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes to prevent memory errors
- Avoid `unsafe` code, especially in critical modules like `Executor` and `RiskManager`
- Example: Use references (`&`) and `Arc` for shared data in multi-threaded environments

### 2. Write Comprehensive Tests
- Use Rust's built-in testing framework (`cargo test`)
- Write unit tests for functions like `send_transaction` in `Executor`
- Test edge cases such as RPC errors or zero liquidity in token pools
- Example: Unit test for `calculate_slippage` in `StrategyEngine` should cover high slippage scenarios

### 3. Use Clippy
- Run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` regularly
- Fix all warnings to ensure code quality
- Add to CI pipeline to enforce code quality standards

### 4. Follow Rust API Guidelines
- Use clear method names and avoid excessive use of generics
- Implement traits like `Debug`, `Clone`, and `Serialize` where appropriate
- Structure code according to Rust's module system

### 5. Use async/await for Asynchronous Operations
- Use Tokio and Axum for asynchronous processing
- Configure Tokio with appropriate worker threads (`#[tokio::main(worker_threads = 6)]`)
- Use channels for inter-module communication

### 6. Manage Dependencies with Cargo
- Regularly update dependencies (`cargo update`)
- Check dependency security with `cargo audit`
- Pin versions to ensure reproducible builds

### 7. Profile and Optimize
- Use tools like `perf` or `flamegraph` to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize compute unit (CU) usage on Solana
- Focus on critical paths in the `Executor` module for HFT transactions

## AI (Augment Code) Best Practices

### 1. Define Clear Goals and Constraints
- Write precise prompts with reference to project documentation
- Example: "Based on RULES.md, add handling for RpcError::TransactionError in the Executor module"
- Specify acceptance criteria: "Run cargo test and confirm all tests pass"

### 2. Provide High-Quality Data and Context
- Give Augment access to documentation (`RULES.md`, architecture docs)
- Use "Enhance Prompt" feature to automatically add code context
- Reference specific files and functions in prompts

### 3. Validate AI-Generated Code
- Always review AI-generated code in diff view
- Test in paper trading mode (`SNIPER_TRADING_MODE=paper`)
- Use unit and integration tests for verification

### 4. Use Version Control
- Create separate Git branches for AI-generated changes
- Integrate changes through pull requests for team review
- Example: `git checkout -b feature/new-strategy`

### 5. Document AI Usage
- Log prompts, results, and implemented changes
- Use documentation to analyze errors and improve processes
- Share successful patterns with the team

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Write Comprehensive Tests
- Include unit tests (e.g., for `StrategyEngine` functions)
- Write integration tests (e.g., between `DataIngestor` and `Executor`)
- Implement E2E tests for the full transaction flow
- Test edge cases like zero liquidity or network errors

### 2. Use Mocking
- Mock external services (Helius, QuickNode) to isolate the unit under test
- Use dependency injection to facilitate testing
- Example: Mock blockchain responses for testing `Executor`
- Use libraries like `mockall` for creating mock objects

### 3. Test in Different Environments
- Test in development, staging, and production (in paper trading mode)
- Detect environment-specific issues early
- Use Docker Compose to replicate production environment locally
- Configure environment-specific settings through environment variables

### 4. Automate Testing
- Use CI/CD pipelines (Kestra or GitHub Actions) to automate tests on every commit
- Example Kestra workflow:
  ```yaml
  id: run_tests
  namespace: solana.sniper
  tasks:
    - id: cargo_test
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
      commands:
        - cargo test --workspace
  ```
- Implement smoke tests for critical functionality

### 5. Monitor Test Coverage
- Use tools like `tarpaulin` to measure test coverage
- Ensure critical parts of the codebase are well-tested
- Set minimum coverage thresholds for critical modules like `Executor` and `RiskManager`

## DevOps Best Practices

### 1. Use Containerization
- Dockerize all services (`sniper-core`, databases) with Docker Compose
- Example configuration:
  ```yaml
  services:
    sniper-core:
      build: ./sniper-core
      ports:
        - "8003:8003"
      environment:
        - TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS=5
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            cpus: '5.0'
            memory: 12G
  ```
- Regularly update Docker images for security
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size

### 2. Consider Orchestration
- For future scalability, consider Kubernetes
- Docker Compose is sufficient for the current monolithic architecture
- Document deployment procedures and rollback strategies

### 3. Monitor and Log
- Implement Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring metrics like transaction latency and CPU/RAM usage
- Use structured JSON logging with the `tracing` library:
  ```rust
  tracing::info!(transaction_id = %tx_id, "Transaction executed successfully");
  ```
- Set up alerts for critical metrics and error conditions

### 4. Implement CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions or Kestra for automation of building, testing, and deploying
- Configure workflows to monitor system health via the `/health` endpoint
- Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates

### 5. Secure the Pipeline
- Manage secrets with Kestra (`{{ secret('KEY') }}`) or environment variables with `SNIPER_` prefix
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for CI/CD pipelines
- Regularly audit system access and security configurations

## SNIPERCOR-Specific Practices

### 1. HFT Security
- Never hardcode secrets (API keys, private keys) in code
- Validate all input from external sources using `serde` and sanitization
- Implement circuit breakers for anomalous market conditions

### 2. HFT Optimizations
- Use Solana SDK for smart transactions with `skip_preflight: true` and `max_retries: Some(0)` for minimal latency
- Optimize server location (Frankfurt/Pittsburgh) for low latency to Solana validators
- Minimize memory allocations in hot paths and use zero-copy operations where possible

### 3. Paper Trading Mode
- Default to paper trading mode (`SNIPER_TRADING_MODE=paper`) to avoid real financial losses
- Require explicit configuration for live trading
- Log clear warnings when in live trading mode

## Potential Challenges and Controversies

- **HFT Competition**: Token sniping is highly competitive, requiring extremely low latency. Monitor network performance and optimize priority fees.
- **HFT Ethics**: HFT may raise ethical concerns related to potential market manipulation. While legal within Solana's rules, ensure compliance with regulations.
- **Security**: Financial applications are targets for attacks. Regular code audits and proper secret management are crucial.
